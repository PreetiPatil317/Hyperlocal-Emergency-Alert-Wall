# Hyperlocal Emergency Alert Wall

This is a small project built by me as part of a rapid innovation event.  
The idea is to create a simple platform where people can post emergency alerts happening around them and view alerts posted by others in real time.

The goal is to make it easy for a community to stay aware of accidents, medical issues, fires, or any urgent situation happening nearby.

## Features

- Users can post alerts by selecting title, category, area, and severity.
- Alerts show up immediately on the “Live Alert Wall.”
- Area-wise filtering to view alerts from specific locations.
- Smart safety tips based on the category (Accident, Fire, Medical, etc.).
- Basic map view using Leaflet (for demo purposes).
- Simple admin panel to delete alerts.

## Tech Used

- HTML, CSS
- PHP
- MySQL
- JavaScript
- Leaflet (for maps)

---

## How it Works

1. User fills the alert form.
2. Data gets stored in the database.
3. Alerts are displayed on the right side with category tag, severity badge, and time.
4. Map highlights the approximate location (Hubballi/Dharwad demo).
5. Safety tips are shown automatically based on the selected category.

## Purpose

This was built as a quick MVP to show how hyperlocal emergency reporting can work.  
It focuses more on clarity and usefulness rather than heavy features.
